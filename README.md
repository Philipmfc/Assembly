# Assembly
I want to learn some assembly.
I currently only do python and some bits and bobs of html, css and JS.
Probably will focus on some project euler stuff or maybe some AOC.
For now im just learning to understand how programs actually function as python doesnt do a massively good thing of introducing pointers and such.
End goal is to end with a few programs i am proud of and learned experience to go and make a thing in assembly.
